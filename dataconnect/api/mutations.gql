# SODC Mutations - Legacy File
#
# This file is kept for backward compatibility but is now deprecated.
# Mutations have been reorganized into feature-specific files:
#
# - user-mutations.gql          - User profile mutations
# - access-control-mutations.gql - Section and access group mutations
# - admin-mutations.gql        - SDK-only mutations (NO_ACCESS)
#
# New mutations should be added to the appropriate feature file.
# This file will be removed in a future version.
#
# For SDK-only mutations (used by Firebase Functions/CLI), see admin-mutations.gql

# SODC Seed Data
#
# This file is reserved for seed data used in development and testing environments.
#
# Usage Guidelines:
# - Seed data is typically used for non-user entities (sections, access groups, etc.)
# - User data should be created through mutations (UpsertUser, CreateUserProfile) rather than seed data,
#   as users are keyed by Firebase Auth UID which cannot be set in seed data
# - Seed data is executed when deploying DataConnect schema
#
# Example seed data structure:
#   mutation {
#     section_insert(data: { name: "Example Section", type: MEMBERS, description: "Example" }) {
#       id
#     }
#   }
#
# Note: Currently no seed data is defined. Add seed data here as needed for development/testing.

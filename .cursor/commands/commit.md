# Git: Add, Commit (AI), Push

Stage all changed files, including new files.  Include files in IDE directories, unless in .gitignore

Generate a concise, high-quality git commit message based on the staged changes.

Create the commit using that message.

Push the current branch to origin.

If there are no changes to commit, do nothing.
